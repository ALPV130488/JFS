<h1>Hi Abishek!!!!</h1>
<p class="para1">hello abishek ,we are learing box model in css.To represent these many charecters 8 bits maynot enough compulsary 
we sholud go for 16 bits hence the size of char in java is 2 bytes 
range: 0 to 65535</p>

<p class="para2">the main advantage of arrays is we can represent huge number of values by using single variable  so
 that readability of the code will be improved ,but the main dis advantage of arrays  is fixed in size 
 I.e once we create an array there is no chance of increasing or decreasing our requirement hence to use 
 arrays concept compulsary we shoud know the size in advance,which may not possible always.</p>
